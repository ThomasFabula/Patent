## Abstract 

Patent DE4332653 (C1)

The monolithically integrated semiconductor element has a bar structure arranged over a diaphragm and located on support webs. The diaphragm, support webs and bar structure are integrally formed from a common semiconductor substrate and have edge faces which are defined by differential etching rates in different crystal orientations of the semiconductor substrate. Such a semiconductor element is produced by applying a mask layer onto opposite surfaces of a semiconductor substrate having a predetermined crystal orientation, subsequent uniform planar destruction or partial destruction of the crystal structure followed by anisotropic etching until the bar structure has been uncovered by etching and a diaphragm with a predetermined thickness remains under the bar. A monocrystalline silicon substrate with a <110> surface crystal orientation has proved particularly suitable. The monolithically integrated semiconductor element according to the invention is, in particular, suitable for use as a sensor or electromechanical transducer.
